## How the STRATA System Works

### 1. Digital Note-Taking System
The foundation of STRATA is a **digital note system** that organizes your life into clear, logical tiers. Here’s how to set it up:

#### Folder Naming Structure
Organize your notes into folders based on the importance of life areas:
- **Start with a number** to rank each area by importance, followed by a **dash** and the name of the area. For example:
  - `01 - Personal` (most important)
  - `02 - School`
  - `03 - Work`

- Within each life area, use subfolders to further organize specific topics. For example:
  - `01 - Personal`
	  - `01 - Health`
	  - `02 - Hobbies`

#### File Format
- Use Markdown (.md) files for your notes. Markdown is lightweight, versatile, and compatible with most platforms, making it easy to write and edit your notes.

### 2. Pocket Sketch- and Notebook
STRATA encourages the use of a **pocket notebook** (A7 size is recommended) to complement your digital notes. This notebook serves as a tool for:
- Capturing spontaneous ideas.
- Drawing diagrams to visualize and clarify your thoughts.
- Brainstorming freely without worrying about structure.

#### Use a Pencil (Suggested)
For flexibility and precision, it’s recommended to use a **pencil** in your pocket notebook. This allows you to:
- Erase and refine your sketches and ideas as needed.
- Keep your notebook neat while encouraging creativity and experimentation.

#### Why This Matters:
- Visual thinking unlocks new perspectives and deeper understanding.
- A portable notebook ensures your ideas are never lost, no matter where you are.
